/* TASK 2:
NOTE: THE DIVISION ALGORITHM HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED. YOU JUST NEED TO
CALL IT IN YOUR CODE.
Division Algorithm states that for every integer x and y where y is a divisor
of x, there exists a unique combination of integers q (quotient) and r (remainder)
such that
x = y * q + r and 0 <= r < d
divisionAlgorithm() derives the quotient and the remainder of a given set of
dividend (a) and divsor (b)
Prototype: void divisionAlgorithm(int a, int d, int* q, int* r);
@param a is the dividend
b is the divisor
q is where the quotient of a / b will be stored
r is where the remainder of a / b will be stored
example: divisionAlgorithm(10, 5, &q, &r) will result to q = 2 and r = 0
divisionAlgorithm(111, 2, &q, &r) will result to q = 55 and r =
1
divisionAlgorithm(87, 9, &q, &r) will result to q = 9 and r = 6
================
NOTE: THE SWAP FUNCTION HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED. YOU JUST NEED TO CALL
IT IN YOUR CODE.
swap() funciton swaps the values of integer variables
Prototype: void swap(int* nVal1, int* nVal2);
@param nVal1 - contains an integer
nVal2 - contains an integer
example: if a = 1 and b = 2, then swap(&a, &b) will result to a = 2 and b = 1
if a = 5 and b = 5, then swap(&a, &b) will result to a = 5 and b = 5
if a = 66 and b = 100, then swap(&a, &b) will result to a = 100 and
b = 66
================
Euclidean Algorithm assumes that a > b. In case a < b, then you simply swap the
values of a and b.
The Euclidean Algorithm repeatedly applies the Division Algorithm to the
divisors and
remainders of integers a and b where b is the divisor to derive a sequence of
quotients (q) and remainders (r) until the remainder becomes 0.
The final divisor computed is then Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) of a and
b.
IF a > b. Then:
a = b(q1) + r1
b = r1(q2) + r2
r1 = r2(q3) + r3
...
ry = rx(qz) + 0.
Therefore, gcd(a, b) = rx
Example 1: gcd(55, 116) = gcd(116, 55) // you need to swap the values of a
and b since a < b.
116 = 55 * 2 + 6 (116 is the dividend, 55 is the divisor, 2 is the
quotient and 6 is the remainder)
55 = 6 * 9 + 1 (55 is the dividend, 6 is the divisor, 9 is the quotient
and 1 is the remainder)
6 = 1 * 6 + 0 (6 is the dividend, 1 is the divisor, 6 is the quotient
and 0 is the remainder)
Since the remainder is 0, therefore, the gcd of 116 and 55 is 1
(divisor in the last line)
Example 2: gcd(77, 5) // no need to swap since a > b
77 = 5 * 7 + 2
5 = 2 * 2 + 1
2 = 1 * 2 + 0
Since the remainder is 0, therefore gcd(77, 5) = 1 (divisor in the last
line)
================
gcdEuclideanAlgorithm - uses the Eucliden Algorithm to derive and return the
Greatest Common Denominator (GCD) of a and b
@param a - a positive integer value

gcdEuclideanAlgorithm(99, 143) return 11

/* TASK 3:
Relatively Prime: Two integers, a and b, are relatively prime when gcd(a, b)
= 1
example: 3 and 2 are relatively prime because gcd(2, 3) = 1

/* TASK 5:
NOTE: getLetter() FUNCTION IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED. YOU JUST NEED TO CALL IT

getLetter() returns a character based on some integer input.

Below is the the list of cases implemented in the function.
case 1: letter = 'A';

example: getLetter(1) return 'A'
getLetter(2) return 'D'
getLetter(3) return 'N'
================
printMessage - prints the corresponding String found in message input with
respect to the cases found in getLetter() function
@param message - String that is encoded as an integer. Every 2 digits in
message starting from the left to right corresonds to a character in getLetter().
In case message has an odd number of digits, you may assume
that there's a zero at the front of it.
For example: if message = 103, then it is equivalent to 0103
which correponds to the string "AN" (see list in getLetter() description).
if message = 10202, then it is requivalent to
100202 which correponds to the string, "ADD" (see list in getLetter() description).
example: printMessage(10202) should display the String, "ADD\n" (without the
double quotes, \n = new line character).
printMessage(60107) should display the String, "SAM\n" (without the
double quotes, \n = new line character).
printMessage(11101) should display the String, "A*A\n" (without the
double quotes, \n = new line character).

ASSUMING THAT findRelativelyPrime() IS CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED.

encryptLetter(3, 5, 3) returns 12 (12 is the ecrypted version of 3
with respect to primes 3 and 5)
encryptLetter(3, 5, 5) returns 5 (5 is the ecrypted version of 5
with respect to primes 3 and 5)
Prototype: int decryptLetter(int p, int q, int encletter)
@param p - prime number
q - prime number
letter - integer corresponding to a letter to be decrypted
example: decryptLetter(3, 5, 1) returns 1 (1 is the decrypted version of 1
with respect to primes 3 and 5)
decryptLetter(3, 5, 33) returns 12 (3 is the decrypted version of 33
